# Go Operations Toolkit <img src="https://github.com/fmjstudios/artwork/blob/5f7696fd09584e4d34d2ab0de3eb52b86037d924/projects/gopskit/icon/color/gopskit-icon-color.png?raw=true" alt="GOpsKit Logo" align="right" width="225"/>

`GOpsKit` (**Go** **Op**erations Tool**kit**) is an open-source [MIT][license]-licensed [Go][go]-based toolkit for working with [Kubernetes]
[kubernetes] Clusters `v1.26` and above. The project is built using Google's [Bazel][bazel] build system in
combination with their first-party [Gazelle][gazelle] `BUILD` file generator.

## üìñ Overview

The toolkit offers a plethora of functionalities like setting up HashiCorp's [Vault][vault] with [`waltr`][waltr], registering various
applications for SSO authentication with [Keycloak][keycloak] using [`ssolo`][ssolo]. Never write [Helmfile][helmfile] `values.yaml`
template files to manage applications on your cluster again. Instead generate them using [`fillr`][fillr]. Are you running your own custom
private Certificate Authority using [Smallstep's CA][smallstep_certificates]? Then you'd likely want to generate and manage PKI values
using [`steppa`][steppa]. The German KBA delivers data in a custom bespoke text-based format, which purely relies on columns to separate
data. _That ain't SQL..._ So let's swiftly generate some usable SQL import script using [`amtrac`][amtrac].

## ‚ú® TL;DR

```shell
# build all projects at once - requires Bazel at .bazelversion
bazel build //...
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools

Like most modern [Go][go] projects the various executables are located within the [cmd][cmd] directory. Here's a
quick-reference list as an overview:

- [`ssolo`][ssolo]: manage SSO authentication for various apps using Keycloak
- [`waltr`][waltr]: configure and manage [HashiCorp's Vault][vault]
- [`fillr`][fillr]: create Helmfile templates automatically
- [`steppa`][steppa]: generate and manage SmallStep PKI values
- [`amtrac`][amtrac]: generate SQL dumps from the German KBA's data files using Docker
