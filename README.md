`GOpsKit` (Go Ops Kit) is an open-source [MIT][license]-licensed [Go][go]-based toolkit for working with [Kubernetes]
[kubernetes] Clusters `v1.26` and above. The project is built using Google's [Bazel][bazel] build system in
combination with their first-party [Gazelle][gazelle] `BUILD` file generator. The toolkit offers various
functionalities like setting up HashiCorp's [Vault][vault] with [`vaultr`][vaultr] or registering various
applications for SSO authentication with [Keycloak][keycloak] using [`opsctl`][opsctl].

## âœ¨ TL;DR

```shell
# build all projects at once
bazel build //...
```
